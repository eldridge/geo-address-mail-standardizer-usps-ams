NAME
    Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer::USPS::AMS - address standardization
    using the United States Postal Service Address Matching System

SYNOPSIS
     my $ms   = new Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer::USPS::AMS;
     my $addr = new Geo::Address::Mail::US;
     my $res  = $ms->standardize($addr);

     $addr = $res->standardized_address
         or die 'unable to standardize address: ' . $res->error;

AMS PATHS
    by default, the USPS::AMS standardizer assumes AMS paths are configured
    as follows:

     datadir: /usr/share/uspsams
     statedir: /var/lib/uspsams

     AMS: datadir/comm
     DPV: datadir/dpv
     ELOT: datadir/elot
     LACSLink: datadir/lacslink
     SUITELink: datadir/suitelink
     Z4CXLOG.DAT: statedir/Z4CXLOG.DAT

    you may change datadir or statedir via those attributes, but the other
    paths are computed and are immutable.

METHODS
  new
    the Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer::USPS::AMS constructor accepts two
    arguments:

    datadir (default: /usr/share/uspsams)
        the path to the USPS AMS shared data directory. this directory
        typically contains all of the database files provided with AMS.

    statedir (defaults to /var/lib/uspsams)
        the path to the USPS AMS state directory. this directory is expected
        to contain the Z4CXLOG.DAT date/time file that is written to by AMS.
        i have no idea what its purpose is; AMS won't initialize without it
        though.

  init
    initializes the AMS database. called during construction by the BUILD
    method.

  standardize($address)
    attempt to standardize an address. the standardize method accepts a
    hashref or a Geo::Address::Mail::US object. a results object will be
    returned. see the documentation for
    Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer::USPS::AMS::Results for details on the
    results object.
